# What is Pega Constellation?

- **New Architecture**: Pega Constellation is a new way to build apps using Pega's low-code platform.
- **Consistent User Experience**: It's a design system that helps create a uniform look and feel for users. Developers can also add their own custom features using popular web technologies like React, Angular, and Vue.
- **Modern Design Pattern**: It uses a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern and includes microservices and stateless architecture. This means the system is made up of small, independent parts that work together, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Flexible and Modular**: The architecture allows for easy customization and integration with other systems. Developers can use the Pega Public API to build custom frontends if needed.
- **Business-Focused**: The approach is centered on creating business-oriented applications that are easy to maintain and update.

Pega Constellation UI changes how users interact with applications by using a new client-side engine. Here's a simpler explanation:

- **Browser-based processing**: The new system does more work in your web browser instead of on the server.
- **Smaller data packets**: Instead of sending large chunks of data, the server now sends smaller, more focused pieces of information.
- **Faster performance**: This makes the application faster and more responsive.
- **Less server load**: The server doesn't have to prepare and send detailed views, reducing its workload.
- **Better user experience**: Overall, this results in a smoother and quicker experience for users.

In simple words, Pega Constellation UI makes applications faster and more efficient by shifting more tasks to the browser and reducing the amount of data sent from the server.

There is a huge shift from our traditional architecture which brings big improvements and flexibility.

1. **Better Performance**: By sending smaller data packets, users experience smoother and faster interactions. Studies show it can reduce network data by up to 7 times and make interactions 3 times faster.
2. **Efficient Communication**: The new system uses a detailed API to ensure the frontend (what you see) and backend (the server) communicate perfectly. This allows developers to add custom features or integrate Pega with their own design systems.
3. **Flexible Frontend**: Developers can use the Pega API with any web technology like React or Angular, giving them the freedom to create the best user experience.
