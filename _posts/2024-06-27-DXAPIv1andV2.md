## Introduction

Pega's DX API is a crucial part of the Constellation UI framework. The evolution from DX API V1 to V2 brought significant improvements and changes. This article outlines the key differences between these versions.

## DX API V1 vs. V2: Key Differences

### 1. Component Structure

- **V1**: Components were class-based and used lifecycle methods.
- **V2**: Shifted to functional components with hooks, aligning with modern React practices.

### 2. State Management

- **V1**: Relied heavily on local component state.
- **V2**: Introduced more robust state management using React hooks and context.

### 3. Performance

- **V1**: Had some performance limitations due to class-based structure.
- **V2**: Improved performance through optimized rendering and better use of React's features.

### 4. Typescript Support

- **V1**: Limited TypeScript support.
- **V2**: Full TypeScript support, enhancing type safety and developer experience.

### 5. API Consistency

- **V1**: Some inconsistencies in API naming and usage.
- **V2**: More consistent API design, making it easier for developers to work with different components.

### 6. Customization

- **V1**: Customization was possible but sometimes complex.
- **V2**: Enhanced customization capabilities with more flexible APIs and better documentation.

### 7. Integration with Pega Platform

- **V1**: Good integration with Pega Platform.
- **V2**: Improved integration, especially with newer Pega Platform features.

### 8. Documentation and Support

- **V1**: Documentation was available but sometimes lacking in detail.
- **V2**: More comprehensive documentation and better community support.

## Conclusion

DX API V2 represents a significant improvement over V1, offering better performance, more modern React practices, and enhanced developer experience. For new projects, it's recommended to use V2, while existing projects using V1 should consider migrating to take advantage of these improvements.
