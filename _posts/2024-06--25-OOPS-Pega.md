## Introduction

Pega Platform incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance its functionality, flexibility, and reusability. This article explores the key OOP concepts in Pega and how they are implemented in application development.

## Key OOP Concepts in Pega

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Pega involves hiding the internal details of an object and providing an interface to interact with it[1]. This is achieved through the use of classes and rules, which encapsulate data and behavior.

Example: A Data-Party class encapsulates all the properties and methods related to a party (person or organization) in the system.

### Inheritance

Pega extensively uses inheritance to promote code reuse and establish hierarchical relationships between classes[1][2]. There are two types of inheritance in Pega:

1. Pattern Inheritance: Automatic inheritance based on class name structure.
2. Directed Inheritance: Explicitly specified inheritance between classes.

Example: The ABCIns-Consumer-PolicyProcessing class inherits from ABCIns-Consumer, which in turn inherits from ABCIns[2].

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Pega allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class[1]. This concept enables flexible and consistent behavior across different object types.

Example: Correspondence and routing work the same way regardless of whether the class is Data-Party-Person or Data-Party-Org[1].

## Classes in Pega

Pega uses two main types of classes:

1. Concrete Classes: These are classes where business transactions can be initiated and processed.
2. Abstract Classes: These classes cannot be instantiated directly but serve as templates for other classes.
